# Introduction

This is my very first Rusherhack plugin, developed for the 2b2t group Conquest.
It is a port of the Hybridious Meteor addon ported to work with the Rusherhack plugin system for Minecraft Java 1.21.4.

# Features

Automatic moss spreading 

Configurable range, cooldown, delay, and max uses per tick.

Optional rotation to face target blocks.

Optional tree growth support (azaleas, saplings, leaves).

Option to allow bone meal from inventory or hotbar only.

# TODO

Just force Crosby to do everything.

Improve rotations 

Better code practices
